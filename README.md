## Overview
This project is a make.com automation that streamlines the parking reservation process with minimal human intervention. Users can easily reserve a parking space by filling out a simple form with their name, email, and car ID. The system then automatically assigns an available parking space and sends a confirmation email to the user.

## Features
 * Simple user input form (name, email, car ID)
 * Automatic assignment of available parking spaces
 * Email confirmation sent to users
 * Minimal human intervention required

## How It Works
 * User fills out the parking reservation form
 * make.com automation processes the form submission
 * System checks for available parking spaces
 * An available space is assigned to the user
 * Confirmation email is sent to the user with reservation details
